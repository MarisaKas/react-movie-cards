# React Movie Cards

A basic application that displays a list of movies as a list of cards. Each card provides movie detail such as title, subtitle, description, image, and rating.

The application is composed of the following components:

* Header - A heading that displays application title

* Movies - The primary (root) component that manages state for Movies and all underlying components. It is also responsible for connecting to _MovieService_ to retrieve movie data

* MovieList - Groups a collection of movies

* MovieCard - Represents a single instance of a movie

* StarRating - Indicates average rating of a movie as a list of 5 stars
